# Streamlight App
# Authors: Nolan Verboomen, Adam Likogiannis, Eiqan Ahsan 
#          and Aidan Murray
# Purpose: App connects to "beacons" placed at iconic landmarks
#          around the city. Using HTTPS messages, sends data
#          to the app which lets the app know which
#          landmark the user is at. App shows the user 
#          the history of the landmark, including 
#          pictures, videos, audio, etc.
